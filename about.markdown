Hi there and thanks for checking out!
This space it's my good aim to give back a little of what I take from the Web every day. A lot of highly knowledgeable people around the world share their expertise allowing others to learn and appreciate subjects otherwise inaccessible.

The things I write are intended to serve two purposes. In a way, are my personal notes on how to do stuff. But, most importantly, are suggestions from a novice to a novice about topics less treated on the Web. 

I enjoy programming, soldering and designing things. I have a scientific education but I don't do this for work. So my knowledge doesn't go much farther than what you read. What I write will surely lack of details and may contain errors despite my commitment to test and document the statements. Should that be the case, let me know and I'll be happy to set it right.

If you are wondering about the name it just describes the space I'm occupying in the tech world: I keep on banging every bit until I get to a result. That's it. No grace, no savoir-faire.
My tools are limited and as the saying goes: *"if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail"*. 

We try to progress every day a little.
